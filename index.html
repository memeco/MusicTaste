          <h3>Short draft</h3>

<p>In late 2012, I had everything set up for applying for a masters at the University of Amsterdam this year. It turns out that I was diagnosed with a 
neurological disease with no cure and of unknown causes - multiple sclerosis. Luckily, where I am from (Brazil), the public healthcare system offers 
free treatment for it. It can cost up to $3,000 per month.</p>

<p></p>Given that I had to cancel my original plan, I came out with a B plan: my masters thesis was about Internet Culture, so why not start a website and try 
a collaborative research project?</p>

<p></p>It's original title is/was "The music taste of the digital natives generation", and it revolves around the concept of 'social distinction' by Pierre 
Bourdieu (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Distinction) +  the criticism of that theory using the concept of "omnivorousness" (http://is.gd/afpuTn). My 
hypothesis basically states that "the digital natives are 'cultural omnivorous' due to the fact that they are displayed a wider range of cultural goods
on the web", or it other words, geeks are generally more electic (music-wise, at least) than the average listener.</p>
</p>
<p>I plan to use data from the Last.fm API at first, (perhaps Spotify and Grooveshark API too), then some interviews and questionaries to prove my point. 
Of course, this is an exploratory research (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_research), so we'll see what we can come up next with the results 
of it.</p>

<p>I couldn't find any specific research related to this topic (sociology of taste + internet culture), but please feel free to send me any related 
studies. =] </p>

<p>I know about this http://pom.sagepub.com/content/40/2/131.short though</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
