          <h3>Short draft</h3>

<p>In late 2012, I had everything set up for applying for a masters at the University of Amsterdam this year. It turns out that I was diagnosed with a 
neurological disease with no cure and of unknown causes - multiple sclerosis. Luckily, where I am from (Brazil), the public healthcare system offers 
free treatment for it. It usually costs up to $3,000 per month.</p>

<p></p>Given that I had to cancel my original plan, I came up with an alternate plan: my masters thesis was about Internet Culture, so why not start a website and try 
an open collaborative research project?</p>

<p></p>It's original title is/was "The music taste of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_native">digital natives</a> generation", and it revolves around the concept of 'social distinction' by Pierre 
Bourdieu (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Distinction">link</a>) +  the criticism of that theory using the concept of "omnivorousness" (<a href="http://is.gd/afpuTn">link</a>). My 
hypothesis basically states that "the digital natives are 'cultural omnivorous' due to the fact that they are displayed a wider range of cultural goods
on the web", or in other words, geeks are generally more eclectic (music-wise, to say the least) than the average listener.</p>
</p>
<p>I plan to use data from the Last.fm API at first, (perhaps Spotify, Pandora, and Grooveshark APIs too), then some interviews and questionaries to check and prove my thesis. 
Of course, this is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_research">exploratory research</a>, so we'll see what we can come up next with the results 
of it.</p>

<p>I couldn't find any specific research related to this topic (sociology of taste + internet culture), but please feel free to send me any related 
studies. =] </p>

<p>I know about these studies: <a href="http://pt.scribd.com/doc/5573359/Music-tastes-link-to-personality-Press-release">http://pt.scribd.com/doc/5573359/Music-tastes-link-to-personality-Press-release</a> and <a href="http://pom.sagepub.com/content/40/2/131.short">http://pom.sagepub.com/content/40/2/131.short</a> though</p>
